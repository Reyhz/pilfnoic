# Information 
Noic is a fox whose fate is decided by Coinflips, anything that he does need to be played on the flip of a coin !\
Jumping on enemies will kill them only if he land on Heads ! If it's Tails the Opposums will steal some of Noic Coins\
Stay alive and try to bring the most coins to Noic's house

# Future of this Project

I've made this game for the Mini Jam 176, and had very limited time on top of the already short 3 days to do this Jam ! ( I even submitted late :( )

I have a lot to do, like adding music, more enemies, better UI, smoother controls, some missing animations, and polishing the gameplay here and there\
I also have some ideas for the game itself, this mean I will update it on the course of the next months to come !
